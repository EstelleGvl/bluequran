## Where was created the the Blue Qur'an?
The Blue Qur'an is a unique Quranic manuscript that was created in South Europe or North Africa and is thought to have contained 600 parchment folios. Its exact place of creation has been a topic of debate, with suggestions including Tunisia, Spain, or Sicily, all of which are in the western part of the Islamic world.

The script used in the Blue Qur'an features gold lettering on a blue background, similar to inscriptions found on notable monuments like the Great Mosque of Cordoba. However, when examining the paleographic characteristics of the letters, it leans towards a Tunisian origin, perhaps during the Aghlabid dynasty (800-909) or at the outset of the Fatimids while they were still based in North Africa before their relocation to Egypt (909-950). 

Furthermore, the fact that the Blue Qur'an was once part of the Great Mosque of Kairouan's collection, along with similarities to other Qurans in the same collection, strongly indicates a Kairouan origin, the city having been a hub of significant artistic and intellectual activity during the Fatimid period. 

Attributing its origin to Andalusia in Spain is less convincing, as there are limited examples of Kufic script from Andalusia available for comparative study.

## Where is it in 2023?

The majority of the pages of this period come from Qur’ans that have been dismembered during the course of the twentieth century, with black ink on parchment. They were found in deposits in Cairo, Damascus, Sana'a and as it is the case for this one, from Qairouan. The ones that are kept in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France for example, were acquired mainly in Cairo at the end of the nineteenth century. Individual sheets appeared on the art market in the early twentieth century and are now in the collections of major museums, including the Los Angeles County Museums of Arts (fig. 2), the Metropolitan Museum of Art (fig. 3), the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin, the David collection in Copenhagen, the Aga Khan, the Arabic World Institute in Paris (fig.4), the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (fig. 5), The Khalili Foundation (fig. 6) as well as numerous private collections.
The greater part of the manuscript is kept today in Tunisia and kept in the National Library and in the Museum of Islamic Art (fig. 7). This folio belongs to a group of pages acquired by a collector/ dealer/scholar, FR Martin in 1912 and perhaps before 1912. Martin made the acquisition of these pages in Istanbul, a source that was recently raised by Sheila Blair. This page was subsequently acquired in "Spink and Son" in London in the 1970s by the Soudavar collection. Sam Fogg Gallery has acquired it from Soudavar in 2013.

The manuscript is kept in its great majority in Tunisia, except for the first four juz, which are scattered in museums and private collections around the world.

Over fifty folios of this Qur'an are now dispersed, in public and private museums worldwide: these all belong to the first seventh of the Qur'an. 

A section of the manuscript is in the National Institute of Art and Archaeology in Tunis, while detached leaves or fragments are in the National Library, Tunis, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Harvard University Art Museums, Cambridge Massachusetts, Metropolitan Museum, Chester Beatty (CBL Is 1405A, folio 1a) and various private collections including the Aga Khan Museum Collection, Toronto, Sarikhani Collection and the Nasser D. Khalili Collection, London. Several leaves have been sold in these rooms, most recently, 22 April 2015, lot 62; 4 October 2011, lot 2; 5 October 2010, lot 7; 11 October 2006, lot 3, and in the sale of the Collection of the Berkeley Trust, 12 October 2004, lot 1.
