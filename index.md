The Blue Qur'an is a unique manuscript of the Quran that was created in North Africa during the 9th or 10th century. It is known for its distinctive blue pages with gold lettering, and for its intricate geometric and floral designs. However, the manuscript has been scattered across multiple institutions and private collections around the world, making it difficult to study and appreciate as a cohesive work of art.
