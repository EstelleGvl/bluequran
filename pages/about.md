**How it started**



## Objectives 
The aim of this research project is to:
- Create a comprehensive list of all known institutions and private collections that hold folios from the Blue Qur'an.
- Map the holding institutions to understand the life of this manuscript and its dispersion.
- For each identified folio, document their provenance and gather relevant metadata.
- Analyze known folios to determine their correct order.
- Create a digital reconstruction of the Blue Qur'an.

## Expected outcomes
The expected outcomes of this research project include:
- A comprehensive list of all known Blue Qur'an folios, their locations, and relevant metadata.
- A digital reconstruction of the Blue Qur'an, that can be studied and appreciated as a complete work of art.
- A better understanding of the dispersion and preservation of the Blue Qur'an, and its significance as a cultural artifact.

"Reconstructing the Blue Qur'an" is an important project that will provide scholars and the general public with a comprehensive understanding of this unique manuscript. This project has the potential to enhance our knowledge of the dispersion and preservation of historical manuscripts, and to serve as a model for similar projects in the future.
