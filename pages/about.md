**Wax helps you create digital exhibits.**   
A digital exhibit is a collection of curated cultural artifacts—manuscripts, paintings, photographs, sculptures, etc—often accompanied by an explicit narrative or argument. Though Wax focuses on images and text, it could be used for sound or video collections with some customization.
